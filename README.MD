## Introduction

This is a small app made only for the purpose of controlling my Sonos speakers at home.

* `sonos_home_ctrl.py` is the current project I'm working on : command line interface to save a config for a set of Sonos speakers
* `guru_sonos.py` is a command line interface app with hardcoded values
* `sonos_web_app,py` is intended to be a web app for more convenient usage on smartphones at home (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
