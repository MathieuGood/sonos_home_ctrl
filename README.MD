## Introduction
This is a small app made only for the purpose of controlling my Sonos speakers with a Python app. 

`guru_sonos.py` is a command line interface app and `sonos_web_app,py` is intended to be a web app for more convenient usage on smartphones at home.

<i>This is a personal app so most of the values are hard coded.</i>


## SoCo
This project uses the awesome Soco library!<br>
